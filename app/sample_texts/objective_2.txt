Objectives

The primary objective is to secure IDAC approval for the full-scale deployment of the AI-Driven Personalized Shopping Experience Platform across all European markets and the integration of enhanced capabilities. The platform expansion aims to achieve a 50% increase in customer engagement metrics and drive EUR 100m in incremental annual revenue by Q4 2025.
We ask the IDAC to approve:

EUR 3.5m investment for platform scaling and enhanced AI capabilities
Implementation timeline of 8 months for full deployment across all markets
Integration of new features including:

Real-time product copy generation tailored to customer segments
Dynamic pricing optimization using predictive analytics
Automated visual merchandising based on customer preferences
Multilingual personalization support for 12 additional languages



The proposed expansion will enable us to achieve 95% automated personalization across all customer touchpoints, reducing manual merchandising efforts by 70% while improving accuracy of product recommendations by an estimated 40%. The investment is projected to generate a return of EUR 4.5 for every EUR 1 spent, with break-even expected within 9 months of full deployment.
The platform represents a critical step toward establishing a fully automated, AI-driven retail ecosystem that can adapt in real-time to changing customer preferences and market conditions. Upon successful implementation, we project capturing an additional 2.5% market share in key European markets by end of 2025.
