Our AI platform for stores started last month showing really good results across stores. The POC was done in 5 locations with ML algorithms analyzing customer behavior & optimizing product placement. KPIs show 40% better conversion & we got $2.5M extra profit!!
This is super important bc our competitors r implementing similar tech & we need to stay ahead. The system uses cutting edge AI/ML to track:

Customer flow
- Hot/cold zones
- Purchase patterns

- Cart analysis

Since Q3 rollout store managers report:
- 50% better sales in premium areas
- 25% boost in customer engagement
- Reduced staff time on analysis by 65%
- ROI of 300%

The tech stack includes:
- Computer vision
