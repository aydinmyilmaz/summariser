Description

The AI-Driven Personalized Shopping Experience Platform was initiated in June 2024 to revolutionize customer engagement across our e-commerce channels. Following the preliminary approval in the July 2024 IDAC meeting, we successfully completed a three-month pilot across our UK and German markets, demonstrating significant improvements in conversion rates and customer lifetime value (CLV). The platform leverages generative AI to create dynamic product recommendations, personalized search results, and tailored promotional content based on real-time customer behavior and historical data.
The pilot phase has exceeded expectations, achieving a 45% increase in average order value (AOV) and a 35% improvement in conversion rates across test segments. Customer engagement metrics show substantial growth, with time spent on site increasing by 28% and cart abandonment rates decreasing by 32%. The platform has processed over 2 million customer interactions, generating EUR 15m in incremental revenue during the pilot phase. These results underscore the platform's potential to drive substantial business growth while enhancing customer satisfaction through hyper-personalized experiences.
This topic addresses the critical need to scale the platform across all markets and integrate additional AI capabilities to maintain our competitive edge in the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape. With increasing competition from digital-native retailers, implementing this advanced personalization solution is essential for maintaining market leadership and driving sustainable growth.
