2. Objectives

The primary objective of the GenAI-Powered Customer Service Chatbot Implementation project is to secure approval to expand the chatbot’s deployment to additional regions and introduce advanced features such as sentiment analysis and personalized recommendations. These enhancements are expected to drive a 25% increase in customer satisfaction and achieve a 90% first-contact resolution rate within the next year. The long-term goal is to establish a scalable support infrastructure that aligns with our global strategy of leveraging AI to drive superior customer experience while reducing dependency on human agents for routine inquiries. Approval from the committee is sought to allocate additional resources for Phase 2, which will involve upgrading the chatbot's capabilities to include real-time sentiment detection and adaptive responses tailored to individual customer profiles. This phase will also introduce multilingual support to enable the chatbot to handle customer interactions in Spanish, Italian, and Mandarin. These features are expected to further enhance customer engagement and retention, particularly in high-growth markets. Moreover, the Phase 2 expansion aims to reduce support costs by an additional 15% through automation, allowing us to reallocate budget toward developing more complex customer service solutions. To support this expansion, the committee’s approval is required for a funding increase of EUR 1.2 million, which will cover the additional computational resources, language processing capabilities, and integration with our customer relationship management (CRM) system. The proposed timeline for Phase 2 spans six months, with pilot tests to begin by February 2025 in targeted regions. Upon successful completion, the chatbot is projected to handle up to 70% of customer inquiries autonomously, representing an estimated savings of EUR 2 million in annual operational costs. In summary, approval of this agenda item will allow the organization to proceed with Phase 2 of the chatbot implementation, further enhancing our customer support capabilities while aligning with strategic goals of operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The GenAI-powered chatbot represents a significant step towards a globally harmonized and scalable customer service model, ensuring our readiness to meet future market demands and improve service quality across all digital touchpoints.
