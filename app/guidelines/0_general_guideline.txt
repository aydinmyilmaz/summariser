### General Information
The Executive Summary serves as the cornerstone document for the IDAC, providing essential, self-contained information that highlights topics requiring the Committee's attention. Its purpose is to promote clarity of thought, stimulate valuable discussions, and equip IDAC members—including the CEO of IIT, MDs of IDA, MDs of NFA overseeing NDA departments, and the MD of IFA—with the insights necessary for informed, impartial decision-making.

Prior to each IDAC meeting, Executive Summaries are distributed to all participants for pre-reading. This ensures attendees are well-prepared for meaningful discussions. During the meeting, the MD responsible for submitting the Executive Summary will present it, guiding the ensuing dialogue. After the discussion, draft meeting minutes will be reviewed and finalized by IDAC participants, incorporating decisions and outcomes from the meeting.

### Formal Guidelines

To maintain a high standard of professionalism and consistency, the Executive Summary must adhere to the following structure and formatting rules:

Writing Style: ⚠️  Use continuous prose, written in full paragraphs.
Language: Follow British English conventions (ensure Microsoft settings are adjusted to British English).
Font: XXX Office font.
Font Size: 10.5.
Margins: Use pre-set margin sizes.
Abbreviations: Introduce abbreviations by spelling out the full term on first mention, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses (e.g., International Development Advisory Committee [IDAC]). Once introduced, abbreviations may be used freely throughout the document, except in Meeting Minute Points, which must remain comprehensible without additional context.
⚠️ Critical Note: Always verify the accuracy of abbreviations and ensure proper usage. Missing or incorrect abbreviations can lead to confusion and undermine the professionalism of the document.
