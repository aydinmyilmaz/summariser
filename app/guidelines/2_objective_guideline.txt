  - A purely informational perspective
  - Concrete actions expected from IDAC (participants)
  - Required IDAC approvals, indicated by the following terminologies:

    - **Information – “inform”**
      An update to the IDAC that does not require official acknowledgment or approval.

    - **Acknowledgement – “acknowledge”**
      A matter that shall be explicitly accepted and recognized as true by the IDAC but does not require approval (e.g., because its final decision authority lies with another entity).

    - **Request/Assignment – “ask”/“task”**
      The IDAC assigns a certain action and requires a follow-up.

    - **Approval – “approve”**
      A matter that shall receive official permission to stand/proceed with by the IDAC.

Outline key business outcomes to be addressed by this topic, including relevant information regarding the substance of the proposal/topic and a brief description of why a particular solution was adopted.
