This initiative aligns with the company’s strategic objectives to streamline customer service processes and enhance customer satisfaction through advanced AI-driven solutions. The pilot phase was successfully conducted over three months, covering key regions including the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, and has shown substantial improvement in handling routine inquiries, freeing human agents to address more complex issues. Since its launch, the chatbot has managed 150,000 customer interactions, achieving a first-contact resolution rate of 85% and reducing response time by 60%. Customer satisfaction scores in pilot regions improved by an average of 20%, with notable increases in Net Promoter Score (NPS) from 45 to 55 in the UK, from 50 to 58 in Germany, and from 47 to 53 in France. The pilot results highlight the chatbot’s potential to standardize responses and maintain high service quality while reducing operational costs. This agenda item addresses the need to expand the chatbot's capabilities to additional languages and service areas, particularly to support our expanding markets in Southern Europe and Asia. With an increasing number of customer inquiries driven by our product portfolio’s growth, the GenAI chatbot will play a pivotal role in ensuring service consistency and scalability. As customer expectations continue to rise, implementing an efficient, AI-powered support solution will be essential to maintain competitiveness and uphold our brand reputation in global markets. \"\"\""
